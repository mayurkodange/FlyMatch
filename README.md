# FlyMatch
FlyMatch is a lightweight, browser‑based tool that lets you optimize your airline fleet in seconds: you pick a known “reference” aircraft and enter its round‑trip time, runway category, and passenger demand, and FlyMatch calculates route distance, figures out how many trips each plane model can make in 24 hours (including multiples of the same model), then greedily selects the best combination to meet your demand without coming more than 150 seats short. Once the picks are made, it shows any leftover demand and offers a quick “omit vs. keep” check on your last aircraft choice—no installs or servers needed, just open the single HTML file in your browser and start matching flights to passenger numbers.  BEFORE USING ADD THE CATEGORY OF THE RUNWAY FIRST, OR ELSE YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO SELECT REFERENCE AIRCRAFTS.
